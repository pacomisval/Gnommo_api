Contributing doesn’t just mean submitting pull requests—there are many different ways for you to get involved, including answering questions in chat, reporting or triaging issues, and participating in the Appapinode Evolution process.\nNo matter how you want to get involved, we ask that you first learn what’s expected of anyone who participates in the project by reading the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.\nWe love pull requests. Here's a quick guide:\nIf you're adding a new feature or changing user-facing APIs, check out the Appapinode Evolution process.\nCheck for existing issues for duplicates and confirm that it hasn't been fixed already in the master branch\nFork the repo, and clone it locally\nnpm link to make your cloned repo available to npm\nFollow Getting Started to generate a testbot\nnpm link Appapinode in your newly created bot to use your Appapinode fork\nCreate a new branch for your contribution\nAdd tests (run with npm test)\nPush to your fork and submit a pull request\nAt this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on, if not accept, pull requests within a few days. We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.\nSome things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:\nMake sure the tests pass\nUpdate the documentation: code comments, example code, guides. Basically, update everything affected by your contribution.\nInclude any information that would be relevant to reproducing bugs, use cases for new features, etc.\nDiscuss the impact on existing Appapinode installs, Appapinode adapters, and Appapinode scripts (e.g. backwards compatibility)\nIf the change does break compatibility, how can it be updated to become backwards compatible, while directing users to the new way of doing things?\nYour commits are associated with your GitHub user: https://help.github.com/articles/why-are-my-commits-linked-to-the-wrong-user/\nMake pull requests against a feature branch,\nFollow our commit message conventions:\nuse imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed” nor “changes”\nCommit test files with test: … or test(scope): … prefix.\nCommit bug fixes with fix: … or fix(scope): … prefix\nCommit features with feat: … or feat(scope): … prefix\nCommit breaking changes by adding BREAKING CHANGE: in the commit body. The commit subject does not matter. A commit can have multiple BREAKING CHANGE: sections\nCommit changes to package.json, .gitignore and other meta files with chore(filenamewithout.ext): …\nCommit changes to README files or comments with docs(README): …\nCody style changes with style: standard\nsee Angular’s Commit Message Conventions for a full list of recommendations.\nStale issue and pull request policy\nIssues and pull requests have a shelf life and sometimes they are no longer relevant. All issues and pull requests that have not had any activity for 90 days will be marked as stale. Simply leave a comment with information about why it may still be relevant to keep it open. If no activity occurs in the next 7 days, it will be automatically closed.\nThe goal of this process is to keep the list of open issues and pull requests focused on work that is actionable and important for the maintainers and the community.\nPull Request Reviews & releasing\nReleasing Appapinode is fully automated using semantic-release. Once merged into the master branch, semantic-release will automatically release a new version based on the commit messages of the pull request. For it to work correctly, make sure that the correct commit message conventions have been used. The ones relevant are\nfix: … will bump the fix version, e.g. 1.2.3 → 1.2.4\nfeat: … will bump the feature version, e.g. 1.2.3 → 1.3.0\nBREAKING CHANGE: … in the commit body will bump the breaking change version, e.g. 1.2.3 → 2.0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching
