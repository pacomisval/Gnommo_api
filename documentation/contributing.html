Stale issue and pull request policy
Issues and pull requests have a shelf life and sometimes they are no longer relevant. All issues and pull requests that have not had any activity for 90 days will be marked as stale. Simply leave a comment with information about why it may still be relevant to keep it open. If no activity occurs in the next 7 days, it will be automatically closed.</p>
<p>The goal of this process is to keep the list of open issues and pull requests focused on work that is actionable and important for the maintainers and the community.</p>
<p>Pull Request Reviews &amp; releasing
Releasing Gnomos_Librery is fully automated using semantic-release. Once merged into the master branch, semantic-release will automatically release a new version based on the commit messages of the pull request. For it to work correctly, make sure that the correct commit message conventions have been used. The ones relevant are</p>
<p>fix: … will bump the fix version, e.g. 1.2.3 → 1.2.4
feat: … will bump the feature version, e.g. 1.2.3 → 1.3.0
BREAKING CHANGE: … in the commit body will bump the breaking change version, e.g. 1.2.3 → 2.0.0</p>
